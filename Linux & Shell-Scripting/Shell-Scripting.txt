--------AUTOMATION----------
Automation is a processes by which we can complete any task with less human intervention or without human interventions.
Completing a task with Scripting(shell scripting , Python Scripting etc...)

--------shell scripting -------
It is a group of commands written in a sequence to automate
Mostly available shells on UNIX/Linux OS are:-
  --bash shell
  --Sh shell
  --Ksh shell
  
which $SHELL  ------To check which shell is assigned to user
curl <url>   ----> curl (short for "Client URL") is a command line tool that enables data transfer over various network protocols.
                 It communicates with a web or application server by specifying a relevant URL and the data that need to be sent or received
wget <url link>  ----> to install any data from link
tar -xvzf <tar-file-name>   -------> To  extract the tar file to install
rm -rf <file-name>   -----> to remove the file 

echo $PATH   ------> To check the current path
ps -ef | grep <process-name>  ---->  It is used to check process is running or not
find / -name <file-name>   ----> to find the list of the location of file-name
export PATH=${PATH}:<path to be added>    ------> To add your path to the machine path temporary
-----To add your path to machine path permanently----
  1. vi .bash_profile
  2. add your path here   eg,  :/home/ec2-user/abc/bin
  3. save it and run the bash_profile 
        source .bash_profile
  4. Now check, echo $PATH
  5. you can see your path added in the PATH of machine permanently  
		
---Bash Shell Scripting -----
  #!/bin/bash
  
Steps to automate the task
1. Get all the manual steps (commands)
2. write a shell script
3. Now execute shell scripts

eg. for apache server
 1. sudo yum install httpd
 2. cd /etc/httpd/conf
 3. vi httpd.conf  --> Listen 80
 4. sed -i 's/80/8080/' httpd.con
 5. cd /var/www/html
 6. vi index.html
 7. systemctl restart httpd
 8. curl http://localhost:8080
 
-----Write and execute shell script----
         simple shell script to install tomcat
	1. To get all the manual steps
 wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.64/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.64.tar.gz
 tar -xvzf apache-tomcat-9.0.17.tar.gz
 rm -rf apache-tomcat-9.0.17.tar.gz
 mv apache-tomcat-9.0.17/ tomcat9
   2. Use command line editor like vi, vim,nano etc and create a file like xyz.sh
   3. Srarts with 
      #!/bin/bash
	  wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.64/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.64.tar.gz
      tar -xvzf apache-tomcat-9.0.17.tar.gz
      rm -rf apache-tomcat-9.0.17.tar.gz
      mv apache-tomcat-9.0.17/ tomcat9
	save this with xyz.sh 
   4. Execute shell script
      using:- sh xyz.sh
	  or bin/bash xyz.sh
	  
	or first give permission to the file 
	    chmod +x xyz.sh
		./xyz.sh
