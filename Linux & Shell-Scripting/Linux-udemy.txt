Linux is actually the name of the Kernel and not the whole operating system (which is a very common misconception!). 
Because there is much more to an operating system than a kernel, 
the whole operating system is recommended to be called the Gnu/Linux operating system, to reflect the efforts of the Gnu project in building the 
other pieces

file ----What is file command in Linux?
			The Linux file command helps determine the type of a file and its data
cat    (cat > output.txt)
ls 1> output.txt 2> error.txt
date > date.txt
date | cut --delimiter=" " --fields=1

alias getdates='date | tee /home/ubuntu/fulldate.txt | cut --delimiter=" " --fields=1 | tee /home/ubuntu/shortdate.txt | xargs echo Hello'

touch  -----creating empty file
mkdir   -----creating empty folder/directory
rm      ---remove file
rmdir   ----remove empty folder/directory
rm -rf                 ------remove the file/directory with force, r=recursive, f= forcefully
rm file*   --- it will remove all the files
cp file1.txt file2.txt  -----cp command to copy the file from source file1 to destination file2
mv     --------moving and renameing the file/directory
ls -a
ls -l
ls -lh
-----------list the contents  a= all file including hidden, l= long form, h=human readable 

sudo apt install locate -y
sudo apt install mlocate -y

locate -------- locate command searches a database for files and return a list of results. it uses mlocate database in-order to funtion
                It cann't give you any result if files is creted after the database updated
            so we need to update the db after files creation. locate command will only list files
			
			
			1. touch file.txt
			2. locate file.txt   ------it won't work, we need to update the db
			3. sudo updatedb      ------update the locate database
			4. locate file.txt   ------it works now and result the output of the file location

find     ------The find command can be used for more sophisticated search tasks than the locate command.
			This is made possible due to the many powerful options that the find command has.
			The first thing to note is that the find command will list both files and directories,
			It doesn't need database, operates on the file system, bit slower than locate command.
			
			ls only applies to the current working directory, 
			while find applies to all files and subdirectories starting from the current working directory
			
	find .     ----for current working directory
	find -maxdepth 4
	find -type d   ----for directories
	find -type f    ----for files only
	find -name "abc.txt"
	find /etc –exec cp {} ~/Desktop \;   ------will copy every item below the /etc folder on the file system to the ~/Desktop directory.
                                                Commands are executed on each item using the –exec option
cat     -----Used to print/read the contents of the files on the terminal

        cat file1.txt
        less file1.txt
         find | less
		 tac file1.txt -----reversing the data 

sort   ----to sort the contents 
        sort file1.txt
		sort -r file1.txt  -----sort and reversing the database
		sort -n filw1.txt    ----sort numerical database
		
grep    ----The ability to search for and filter out what you want from a file or standard output makes
			working with the command line a much more efficient process.
			
			grep hello myfile.txt
			ls /etc | grep *.conf
			
			grep -i   --------Search in a case insensitive manner
						(upper case and lowercase don’t matter).
	
tar -zxvf file1.tar.gz    -----untar the file/ compressed 
sudo apt purge <packagename>    ------remove file/uninstalling 
sudo apt autoremove              ------remove unwanted dependencies
sudo apt clean             ---------delete All compressed package archieves
